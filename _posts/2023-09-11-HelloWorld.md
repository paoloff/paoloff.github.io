# Welcome

My first post - let's gest started with some tests.

* Some math:







$$ \Delta L = L_0 \alpha \Delta T$$


$$ \frac{\pi^2}{6} = \sum _{n=1} ^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} $$


* Now, some code:
```python
import numpy as np
x = 4 + np.pi
print("This is a piece of code in Python")
```

* Finally, a random image:
